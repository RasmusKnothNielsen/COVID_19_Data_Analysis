# COVID_19_Data_Analysis
Repo containing some work done with trying to identifying key elements for the research in the COVID-19 virus. Did this to train my machine learning capabilities and general Data Analysis.

The Dataset that I have been working on, is the following:

Up until now, i've made some Wordclouds, that gives a hint about the most prevailing terms in the datasets. 
I've done two different separations, to give a bit more granular look.

Divided the Dataset up into
- Four chunks ("first_quarter.png", "second_quarter.png", "third_quarter.png" and "fourth_quarter.png")
- Ten chunks ("1.png", "2.png", "3.png" ... "10.png")

and made wordclouds out of them.
